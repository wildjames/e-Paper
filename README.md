This is my own fork of the WaveShare e-Paper library, to which I've added a nice little weather station.

I've had a right time of it with this damned hat. The Pi I'm using is a Raspberry Pi Zero W v1.1 board, and it seems to crash for reasons completely unknown to me. Examples will work fine for a while, then sometimes crash the whole Pi... I had no luck importing this module from anywhere but this repo, as that universally causes the same crash! The workaround is now to run the example, then the weather script I added here.
